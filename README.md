# mute
Mute Linux system volume for the specified number of seconds

This is handy for when you are listening to Rdio, or some other music service that has commercials.

I used to hit the mute button on my keyboard, but I would frequently forget to unmute.  This application will automatically unmute after the specified number of seconds.  On my system, I set the time to 27 seconds because commercials on RDio are 30 seconds, and it usually takes me a few seconds after a commercial begins before I hit the panel button.
